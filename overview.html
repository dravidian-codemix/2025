        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Offensive language detection is a critical task in natural language processing, particularly in the context of
          online discourse, where harmful content can spread rapidly. Identifying offensive language is challenging due
          to the varied ways in which offense is conveyed, including subtle linguistic cues, code-mixing, and cultural
          context. Code-mixing is a prevalent phenomenon in a multilingual community, and the code-mixed texts are
          sometimes written in non-native scripts. Systems trained on monolingual data fail on code-mixed data due to
          the complexity of code-switching at different linguistic levels in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shared task presents a corpus for offensive language identification of code-mixed text in Dravidian
          languages (Tamil-English, Malayalam-English, Kannada-English, and Tulu-English). This task is further
          complicated in low-resource languages where limited annotated datasets exist for offensive speech detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shared task presents a gold-standard dataset for offensive language detection in Tamil, Malayalam,
          Kannada, and Tulu, enabling researchers to develop robust classification models. The dataset consists of
          social media comments and posts that are categorized into four classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not Offensive (NO):</strong> Content without any offensive elements.</li>
          <li><strong>Offensive Untargeted (OU):</strong> Offensive content that is not directed at a specific
            individual or entity.</li>
          <li><strong>Offensive Targeted (OT):</strong> Direct attacks on an individual or group, including hate speech
            targeting a community, ethnicity, caste, or gender.</li>
          <li><strong>Not Tamil/Not Malayalam/Not Kannada/Not Tulu (NT):</strong> Content that does not contain the
            Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, or Tulu languages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The primary goal of this shared task is to build and evaluate systems that can automatically classify social
          media text into these four categories. Participants will be provided with training, development, and test
          datasets to develop their models. Given the real-world class imbalance in offensive content, models must be
          designed to handle the skewed distribution of data effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as we know, this is the first shared task on offensive language detection in Tulu. By organizing this
          task, we aim to foster research in under-resourced languages, improve computational approaches for offense
          detection in multilingual and code-mixed settings, and contribute to the responsible use of AI in moderating
          harmful content online.

          <h2>Broad Categories</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
            <li>Machine Learning (ML)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Use Cases</h2>
          <p>
            Offensive language detection is a crucial task in natural language processing, particularly in the era of
            digital communication, where social media platforms serve as primary spaces for public discourse. The rise
            of online abuse, cyberbullying, hate speech, and toxic interactions necessitates the development of
            automated systems that can detect and mitigate offensive content. The challenge becomes even more complex
            due to code-mixing with Kannada, English, and other languages, as well as the use of non-native scripts,
            making traditional offensive detection models ineffective.
          </p>
          <p>
            By releasing a gold-standard dataset of offensive comments collected from YouTube discussions on news,
            entertainment, and social issues, this shared task aims to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enable researchers to develop robust offensive language detection models for the Dravidian languages
              Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada, and Tulu.</li>
            <li>Assist social media platforms in moderating harmful content and ensuring safe online interactions.</li>
            <li>Support law enforcement agencies and policymakers in identifying and mitigating the spread of hate
              speech, cyberbullying, and targeted abuse.</li>
            <li>Help businesses and brands monitor online discourse related to their products, ensuring that discussions
              remain civil and constructive.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This shared task will bring together academia, industry, and social media platforms to develop AI-driven
            solutions for identifying offensive content in the Dravidian languages, contributing to safer and more
            inclusive digital spaces.
